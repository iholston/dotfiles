Glove80 FW can be compiled directly from MoErgo's online layout editor: (my.glove80.com)[https://my.glove80.com/]

Occasionally backing up the ZMK Keymap in case I lose access to the layout editor in the future.

# Loading FW from my.glove80.com to keyboard

1. Hit `Save and Build firmware`. A file with `.uf2` will be downloaded.
2. Plug first **right** half via USB-C. Hit `magic + e`. Upload the FW to the bootloader disk. It will automatically eject.
3. Plug **left** half via USB-C. Hit `magic + i`. Upload the FW to the bootloader disk. It will automatically eject.
4. Done.
